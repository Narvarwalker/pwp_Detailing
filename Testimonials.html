				<p>"Though the prices are higher than routine auto detailers, the results on my wife’s 2003 Mercedes SL500 were clearly worth the difference. The care and concern that Power Washing Pro's showed with the quality of the effort was almost as if he was performing the detail on his own vehicle. The car looks as good or better than it did when I purchased it and I would not hesitate to recommend Ciro and his detailing services to anyone. As in most things in life, you get what you pay for!</p>

			<p>"PWP car detailing was friendly and professional. They take the time to do what others will not do, like properly tape off emblems, rubber stripping etc before buffing. This is particularly important to me because my car is 32 years old. Not only has the car never looked better, they gave me an education on how properly wax my car and how to avoid those nasty swirl marks you get in black paint. A job well done!" </p>

		<blockquote><p>"I thought I was crazy attentive to detail when it came to my cars and how they were detailed. Power Washing Pro's takes it to another level. He’s responsive, dependable and then his work is like a masterpiece. He really cares and take pride in his work – a rare find in today’s fast food like world. I would recommend him without hesitation. Great guy and great products. Expensive, but worth every penny!"</p>
